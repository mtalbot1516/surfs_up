# Analysis of Tempuratures of Oahu for our surf ice cream shop!
## Overview 
### We created an analysis of tempuratures in December and June to determine if an Ice Cream & Surf Shop was fgeasible year round.

## THe key differences between December and June
### * The weather was mroe variable in Dec than June. Dec had a high standard devation of 3.746, while June's was 3.257 
### * The tempurature was colder accross the board in December. However, the max temp between the two only varied 2 degrees. To see more detail into these differences, please see "Dec Temps.JPG" and "June Temps.JPG"
### * There are less recordings in December(1517) than there are June(1700)

## Summary
### When comparing the data, it is clear that tempuratures are hotter in June, however, December is still warm in Oahu. This confirms that we the shop could pull in momney in all seasons, as even its winter season is still warm enough for ice cream and surfing. For additional analysis, I would query more information about the stations locations and the percipitation. Without analysis, we do not know if there is any weather variation between different locations in Oahu. we could use the station locations to select a location for a shop by finding the station with the highest average tempurature year round
